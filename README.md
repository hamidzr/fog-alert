# Intrusion Detector

CC Project



## configuration
use `config.ini` files in to setup the communication (in `edge/communication/`) and the server app (in `server/`)


## installation
we use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for managing python environments.

whereever you see a `Pipfile` you'll need to run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies. Then use `pipenv run python PYTHONFILEHERE` to execute a python script
